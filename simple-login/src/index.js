// side effects are concerned with anything else other than rendering UI and reacting to user input. Example: store data in browser storage, send http requests to backend servers, set and manage timers etc.
// these tasks must happen outside of normal component evaluation and render cycle - especially since they might block/delay rendering (ex: http requests)

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
